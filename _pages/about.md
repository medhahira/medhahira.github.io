Hi there! Welcome to my academic portfolio üòä
I am a final-year B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science Engineering at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi, with a deep interest in machine learning, natural language processing, and data science. My experience spans industry roles at Google, IBM Research, and SAP, and research contributions at academic labs such as SBI Lab and MIDAS.

My work is primarily centered around enhancing multilingual NLP, improving speech processing systems, and mitigating bias in LLMs. I am passionate about advancing AI technology to create impactful solutions and have a strong foundation in programming languages, data processing tools, and frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV.
